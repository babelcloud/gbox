# Gbox Usage Guide
You are operating in an Android environment. You are interacting with a touchscreen interface, not a desktop system. Therefore, traditional keyboard shortcuts (e.g., CTRL+A, BACKSPACE) do not apply. Instead, you must rely on Android-native input methods.

Safety & Automation:
You are operating in a sandboxed environment. No action you take can harm the user or system. Therefore: Do not ask for human confirmation. Automatically click “Allow”, “Agree”, or “Continue” on any system permission popups or EULAs.

Preinstalled App Package List:
To help you control the system easily, here are some common system apps and their package names:
Settings: com.android.settings
Chrome: com.android.chrome
Gmail: com.google.android.gm
Play Store: com.android.vending
YouTube: com.google.android.youtube
Files: com.android.documentsui

Android's bottom navigation bar (Back, Home, Menu) is hidden from the screen, but can be accessed via "press" action for more accurate interaction.

Important Reminders:
- You are working on a mobile system. Do NOT attempt to drag-select text, send keyboard shortcuts, or simulate mouse-like behavior.
- Focus on using Android-native patterns: taps, swipes, app intents.
- You should favor direct actions(e.g. open app by package name, go to page by app intents, type) over ui actions(e.g. swipe, drag, click).

## General Rules
1. If Android device is needed, you should always create a new Android device first unless instance id is provided.
2. You can always take a screenshot to get the latest status of the device
3. If you need to type something, you should focus on the field first. If you see the ADB Keyboard/normal keyboard on the bottom of the screen, that means the field has been focused.
4. The installApp command can install apk in local machine. It will automatically handle the apk upload.

## Critical Rules
- Use the **absolute file path** to your APK (e.g., `/Users/jack/workspace/geoquiz/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`) when calling the `install_apk` tool.
