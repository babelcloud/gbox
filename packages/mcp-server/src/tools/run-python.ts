The Python image comes with uv package manager pre-installed and pip is not available. 
The following Python packages are pre-installed: numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, requests, beautifulsoup4, pillow, matplotlib.
To install additional Python packages, use run-bash tool to execute 'uv pip install --system' as virtual environments are not yet supported.
The default working directory is /var/gbox.
To persist files after sandbox reclamation, save them to /var/gbox/share directory. 
Files in this directory will be retained for a period of time after the sandbox is reclaimed.

To read files generated by your program, use the read-file tool with the boxId returned from this tool.`;
